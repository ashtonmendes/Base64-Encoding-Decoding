First run 'make' to compile and create executables.
Once the executable 'hw1' is created, it's ready to use!

Usage:
------

1. ./hw1 hexdump [file]
2. ./hw1 enc-base64 [file]
3. ./hw1 dec-base64 [file]

where [file] is the path to the file which has to be processed. It is optional. If not specified, it will read form stdin.
